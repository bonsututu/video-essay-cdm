# Video Essay CDM

**Summary**
This is a project that covers "why social media sucks". From the beginnings of Facebook, to today's big boom of users on TikTok, social media has changed a whole lot. Throughout this video essay, I cover how social media has gone from a space that is used for casual viewing and posting to a space where most user’s have curated posts, ads are on every other scroll, and has all around become addicting.

Growing up, I’ve used social media and in my time of use, I have seen many changes on almost all the platforms I use that have affected the user’s experience as well as the communities that use these platforms.
