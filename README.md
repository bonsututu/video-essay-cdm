## **Summary**
This is a project that covers "why social media sucks". From the beginnings of Facebook to today's big boom of TikTok users, social media has changed a lot. Throughout this video essay, I cover how social media has gone from a space used for casual viewing and posting to a space where most users have curated posts, ads are on every other scroll and has all around become addicting.

Growing up, I’ve used social media and in my time of use, I have seen many changes on almost all the platforms I use that have affected the user’s experience as well as the communities that use these platforms.  

My video essay is made up of three chapters titled "Short-Form Video Addiction", "Heavy Post Curation", and "Ads in Social Media". I provided In this video, my thesis of "social media sucks" is supported by several ideas about how social media nowadays is very addicting due to short-form media, posts are heavily curated now, and platforms are covered with advertisements.

I speak about my experiences using social media, confessing to my very own short-form media addiction. I also include my own takes on how posts are finely hand-picked to show the best version of one's self rather than staying authentic and true to themselves. To keep viewers engaged and understanding of my argument, I've included sound bites, stock videos, and transitions between chapters to keep some organization of my video format.
